# Friendly Monster Painting

This is the client facing website for Friendly Monster Painting, LLC.

This is a personal project I have taken on in order to support my fiancee's family business.

The current website can be found [here](http://friendlymonsterpainting.com/). Any website with a tiled background and a ton of absolutely positioned elements deserves a refresh.

The primary goals here are to:

1. Make this site as clean and as simple as possible
2. Make this site accessible
3. Make this site responsive
4. Make this site using vanilla JavaScript

This project was scaffolded using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

If you or a friend you know in the Atlanta area needs painting done, please reach out to [Friendly Monster Painting](info@friendlymonsterpainting.com) for an estimate!
